# Net Generated Electricity & Fossil Power in the US in 2023

### Problem Statement
Interested in understanding the electricity consumption and generation in the US, I took a public dataset about electricty and fossil generated power to analyze and visualize through Tableau. Here, I imagined myself as a data analyst who was asked by an engineering team to analyze the energy consumption by states and physical unit type to make data-driven decisions about managing electricity resources. 

### Tableau Dashboard:
The link to the dashboard could be found here: [Net Power Generation Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/NetPowerGenerationVisualization/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### Datasets:
The dataset being used for this project could be found in the [Datasets folder](https://github.com/ThuyenP/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Electricity%20%26%20Fossil%20Power/Datasets)
